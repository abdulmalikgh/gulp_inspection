                        There are various laws regulating oil and gas in Nigeria. The principals among these laws are the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria (as amended) and the Petroleum Act, which vested ownership and control of oil found anywhere in Nigeria in the Federal Government. This includes oil located within any land in Nigeria, under its territorial waters, continental shelf or within its exclusive economic zone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The government participation in the oil & gas industry is through the National Oil Company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nigeria has several legislations, regulations and directives regulating various aspects of the oil industry. The Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) pending before the National Assembly aims to harmonize all the legislations and significantly restructures the industry, particularly the functions of the various regulatory agencies, intending to eliminate overlaps. The draft law, among other objectives, aims to:

                    <p>
                        Make sweeping reforms by repealing laws like the Petroleum Act 1969.
                        Create new institutions to govern the operations of the industry, incorporation, and privatization of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).
                        Transform the existing unincorporated joint ventures between the multinational oil companies and the NNPC into incorporated joint ventures.
                        In an attempt to secure the passage of the bill, the government has divided the bill and intends to pass it in phases. The first one is the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill. The aims of the bill are to:

                        The upstream sector, the most active sector of the Nigerian petroleum industry, is largely export-focused and until recently dominated exclusively by international oil companies. The Nigerian government's marginal fields licensing regime and its local content development drive have led to increased participation of indigenous oil companies in the petroleum industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Constitution vests ownership of mineral resources, including oil and gas, exclusively in the federal government and further confers on the federal government the exclusive power to make laws and regulations for the governance of the industry.

                    In conclusion, several laws are regulating the oil and gas industry in Nigeria. This is because the oil & gas is very critical to the Nigerian economy; the earnings from oil & gas export is up to 90% of the total export earnings of the government. The most recent and reforming legislation is the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development Act 2010 that mandates the compulsory participation of Nigerian citizens in the upstream sector.
